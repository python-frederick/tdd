# Test Driven Development Sample Code

This repository contains code presented at the Python Frederick talk
from February 2016. The code demonstrates the basics of unit testing.
It is *not* an exemplary demonstration of great API design. The sample
project, a calculator, is a straight forward concept to expore and
helps to avoid distraction from the real subject matter: testing.

The code shown here is the final state of the demonstration.
There are various git tags to represent the different steps in the process.
Each tag has a name like `step1`.
To view the number of steps, run `git tag` from a terminal.
To look at an individual step, run `git checkout stepX`
where `X` is the number in the step sequence.
